      <h2>Food Deserts</h2>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:320px;"> <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*hjUvCCXJcYp5olX2mJzkWA.jpeg"></div>
      <p>
        On the issue of food deserts, two main health problems come to mind:
        obesity and diabetes. Food deserts are characterized by their lack of
        fresh, organic food and abundance of processed, unhealthy food. Due to
        the lack of access to healthy food, people living in food deserts develop
        unhealthy eating habits, often at a very young age, which can be
        detrimental to their development by causing cognitive difficulties,
        weakening the immune system, and slowing growth due to lack of proper
        nutrition. One of the major effects of a poor diet is weight gain.
        This can in turn lead to obesity, causing diseases such as diabetes,
        heart disease, and high blood pressure, and increases the risk for 
        stroke and cancer.

      <h2>Food Waste</h2>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:320px;"><img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2F290e774c-f511-11e8-ae55-df4bf40f9d0d?fit=scale-down&source=next&width=700"></div>
      <p>
        Food waste has numerous negative effects on the world. As you can imagine,
        it allows for the continuance of hunger and creates huge economic losses.
        1.3 billion tons of food is wasted each year. That’s enough food to feed
        3 billion people, well over the 805 million people who suffer from
        hunger each year. In 2010, the United States alone wasted 33.79
        million tons of food, enough to fill the Empire State Building 91
        times. In addition to this, $160 billion in food is wasted annually
        in the US.
        <br>
        <br>
        However, hunger and the economy aren’t the only areas affected by food
        waste. The environment is also largely impacted by it. Food waste leaves
        a massive carbon footprint on the world (3.3 billion tons of greenhouse
        gases) and ranks the top third emitter of greenhouse gases after the
        US and China. Not only does wasting food emit a substantial amount
        of greenhouse gases, it also causes 250 cubic kilometers of water
        to go to waste -- enough water to fill Lake Geneva three times.
        The amount of food produced but left uneaten is enough to occupy
        30% of all the agricultural land in the world (1.4 billion hectares).
        While it may be hard to believe, most food waste happens during
        the process of production (54%) while 46% occurs in distribution
        and consumption.
