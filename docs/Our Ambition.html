    <p style="font-size:1.6vw;"><b>Food Deserts and Eating Habits</b>
      <br>
“Food deserts” are a prominent issue in the United States. Lacking healthy food options can take its toll on a person’s health, but even if stores are able to offer organic fruits and vegetables, it doesn’t necessarily ensure that families will purchase them. It would still be cheaper for them to purchase unhealthy, fast foods rather than wholesome, more expensive organic food. That being said, simply making better quality foods available to people wouldn’t ensure healthier eating habits. While choosing cheaper foods over healthy foods may seem like the better option now, it can have negative effects in the long run. Unhealthy diets can lead to obesity and the development of diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.
<br>
<b>Food Waste</b>
<br>
People all over the world are severely impacted by food waste, yet this is an issue that lacks proper attention. 1.3 billion tons of food a year is wasted. That’s ⅓ of all the food grown worldwide. Hundreds of millions of people around the world suffer from hunger, lacking enough food to live a healthy life, and greenhouse gas emissions are increasing, playing a large role in accelerating climate change. If we are able to decrease the amount of wasted food, rates of hunger as well as greenhouse gas emissions would significantly decrease.
<br>
<b>Our Ambition</b>
<br>
At Better Food for a Better World, our ambition is simple. We strive to educate and inform people about food deserts and food waste to bring awareness to these growing issues, encouraging healthy eating habits and waste reduction.
